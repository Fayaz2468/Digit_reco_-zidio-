# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning approach to recognize handwritten digits. Leveraging popular deep learning libraries, the project aims to accurately identify digit images through training and evaluation on a dataset like MNIST.

## Project Overview

The notebook provides an end-to-end implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to recognize handwritten digits. This project could serve as a basis for further experimentation with model architectures or transfer learning on digit datasets.

## Dataset

This project uses the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), a benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is a grayscale, 28x28 pixel square.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, normalizing the pixel values, and preparing data for training and testing.
2. **Model Architecture**: Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify digits.
3. **Training**: Compiling and training the model with defined hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluation**: Testing the model and analyzing its performance on the test dataset.
5. **Prediction**: Running the model on sample data for prediction.


## Results

The model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in image recognition tasks.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different architectures.
- Apply data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Fine-tune the model with transfer learning.
